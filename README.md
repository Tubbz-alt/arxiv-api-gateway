# arXiv API Gateway

This project pulls together documentation (including specifications) for the
arXiv API Gateway. The intended audience is arXiv API users, including partner
platforms.

Documentation for individual services is maintained in the respective
repositories for those services. This project largely involves pulling down
those docs into a single resource, which is then published as (almost) static
pages.
